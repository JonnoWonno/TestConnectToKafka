# TestConnectToKafka

So, I had to run create an empty Repository on Github website (don't add a ReadMe or anything). The name of the repository was the name of my project. 

The creation page shows the commands below: 
  git remote add origin https://github.com/JonnoWonno/TestConnectToKafka.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main

This got my local repository linked to theone in GitHub.
