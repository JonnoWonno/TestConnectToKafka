# TestConnectToKafka

I created the project locally on my C: (actually D:) Drive, and managed to init a git repository locally. I then wanted to get this repository into the 'cloud' onto GutHub.com. I search for creaqting GitHub Repository from local repository and found this YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbQ2bYHxxEA which kind of got me on the right track.

So, I had to run create an empty Repository on Github website (don't add a ReadMe or anything). The name of the repository was the name of my project. 

The creation page shows the commands below: 
  git remote add origin https://github.com/JonnoWonno/TestConnectToKafka.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main

This got my local repository linked to the one in GitHub.
